# chip8-binary-decoder
Takes a chip8 game file and outputs another file with the instructions in plain text. Can't guaratee that it works correctly but it's what I interpreted was supposed to be the correct output based on the documentation.
# usage
it's very basic, just run the program with 2 arguments, the first being the game file you want to convert and the second one being the output file you want the program to write to.
# installation
I really don't know other than downloading the files and compiling them with rust on your system. Didn't really make this as a tool to be used, just as a project to get familiar with git and rust.
